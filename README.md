Repository's name mustn't contain company's name. Checked.

After cloning the project, please open it using PyCharm. Then:
1. click Add Configuration (top-right corner) -> click on '+' -> set Python; set Name to FirstTask; set Script path to ...\FirstTask\FirstTask.py; choose Python interpreter; click OK, you are ready to launch FirstTask.
2. Add two more configurations like this for SecondTask and ThirdTask, make sure Script path is set to respectively: SecondTask\tasks.py, ThirdTask\ThirdTask.py (configuration names dont really matter but I recommend naming them FirstTask and SecondTask); you are ready to launch all 3 tasks.
3. If you want to switch between tasks, just use Configuration ComboBox in top right corner.
4. Please import missing libraries (argparse/sqlite3/datetime/hashlib/pathlib) if PyCharm asks you to.

PS.:
4. I've merged Exception and Car classes into one file only to make it a bit easier to run configure/project.
5. If you are running SecondTask, please use the same Configuration window as before to type in any input parameters; database file (sqlite) will be created in your 'home' directory, regardless of Windows/Linux/Mac you are using; don't forget to delete the tasks_database.db file afterwards. In terms of input parameters, the program explicitly follows your example from the content of the task. 
6. Third Tasks: 935 matching passwords.

Thanks from the mountain for your patience! ;D
